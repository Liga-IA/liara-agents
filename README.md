# LI(A)RA Project

LI(A)RA is a project by students and professors from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) conducted by the Liague of Artificial Intelligence (LIA) aiming to study and implement multi-agent technologies.

In this repository, we implement the team's solution used during the [MAPC 2022](https://multiagentcontest.org/). 
It was the first year our team participated in Multi-Agent Programming Contest, and we finished it in 4th. 

Our soluction is implemented using [Jason](https://jason.sourceforge.net/) platform.
